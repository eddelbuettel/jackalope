This document provides brief examples of how `jackalope` can be used
to generate sequencing data that can inform some common sampling decisions for HTS
studies.

For an example reference assembly, I simply simulated one of size 1 kb
using the following code:

```{r examples-create-assembly}
ref <- create_genome(10, 1e2)
```


This resulted in the following `ref_genome` object:

```{r examples-print-assembly, echo = FALSE}
print(ref)
```


For molecular-evolution information, I used the TN93 model,
an insertion rate of `2e-5` for lengths from 1 to 10,
and
a deletion rate of `1e-5` for lengths from 1 to 40.
By default, the `indel` function creates rates that are proportional to
`exp(-L)` for indel length `L` from 1 to the maximum length.


```{r examples-mevo-objects}
sub <- sub_TN93(pi_tcag = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4),
                alpha_1 = 0.0001, alpha_2 = 0.0002,
                beta = 0.00015)
ins <- indels(rate = 2e-5, max_length = 10)
del <- indels(rate = 1e-5, max_length = 40)
```


## Assembling a genome

The example here produces FASTQ files from the known reference assembly that could
test strategies for how to assemble a similar genome using HTS data.

The first strategy is to use only PacBio sequencing.
The PacBio Sequel system produces up to 500,000 reads per
Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) cell, so you could
run the following for two cells:

```{r examples-reads-for-assembly-pacbio, eval = FALSE}
pacbio(ref, out_prefix = "pacbio", n_reads = 2 * 500e3)
```

An alternative, hybrid strategy uses
1 SMRT cell of PacBio sequencing and
1 lane ($\sim 500$ million reads) of $2 \times 100$bp Illumina
sequencing on the HiSeq 2500 system (the default Illumina system in `jackalope`):

```{r examples-reads-for-assembly-hybrid, eval = FALSE}
pacbio(ref, out_prefix = "pacbio", n_reads = 500e3)
illumina(ref, out_prefix = "illumina", n_reads = 500e6, paired = TRUE,
         read_length = 100)
```


The last strategy combines 1 lane of $2 \times 100$bp Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing
with 1 flow cell of $2 \times 250$bp mate-pair sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq v3.
The mate-pair sequencing uses longer fragments (defaults are mean of 400 and
standard deviation of 100) to better cover highly
repetitive regions.

```{r examples-reads-for-assembly-illumina, eval = FALSE}
illumina(ref, out_prefix = "ill_pe", n_reads = 500e6, paired = TRUE,
         read_length = 100)
illumina(ref, out_prefix = "ill_mp", seq_sys = "MSv3",
         read_length = 250, n_reads = 50e6, matepair = TRUE, 
         frag_mean = 3000, frag_sd = 500)
```




## Estimating divergence between populations

Here, I will demonstrate how to generate population-genomic data of a type that might
be used to estimate the divergence between two populations.
I first use the `scrm` package to conduct 
coalescent simulations that will generate segregating sites for 10 variant haplotypes
from the reference genome.
Five of the haplotypes are from one population, five from another.
The symmetrical migration rate is 100 individuals per generation.
I set the population-scaled mutation rate
($\theta = 4 N_0 \mu$) to `10` for this example.

```{r examples-divergence-scrm, eval = FALSE}
library(scrm)
ssites <- scrm(paste("10", ref$n_chroms(), "-t 10 -I 2 5 5 100"))
```

Using the previously created objects for molecular evolution information (`sub`,
`ins`, and `del`), I create haplotypes from the reference genome:

```{r examples-divergence-create, eval = FALSE}
haps <- create_haplotypes(ref, haps_ssites(ssites), sub, ins, del)
```
```{r examples-divergence-create-do, echo = FALSE}
# For the purposes of the vignette, I'm just going to use `haps_theta` so I
# don't have to (1) load scrm to build the vignette or (2) keep a relatively
# large internal data file to store the scrm output
# theta of 0.05 gives the same # mutations as using `ssites`
set.seed(7809534)
haps <- create_haplotypes(ref, haps_theta(theta = 0.05, n_haps = 10), sub, ins, del)
```

This results in the following set of haplotypes:

```{r examples-divergence-create-print, echo = FALSE}
print(haps)
```


For a file of true divergences from the reference genome, the `write_vcf` function
writes the `haplotypes` object to a VCF file:

```{r examples-divergence-write-vcf, eval = FALSE}
write_vcf(haps, "haplotypes")
```


Lastly, I simulate 1 lane of $2 \times 100$bp Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing.
In this case, individuals within a population are pooled, and the population
sequences are derived from are identified by barcodes.

```{r examples-divergence-illumina-pool, eval = FALSE}
illumina(haps, out_prefix = "haps_illumina", n_reads = 500e6, paired = TRUE,
         read_length = 100, barcodes = c(rep("AACCGCGG", 20), 
                                         rep("GGTTATAA", 20)))
```


The below example instead has each individual haplotype's reads output to separate
FASTQ files:

```{r examples-divergence-illumina-individual, eval = FALSE}
illumina(haps, out_prefix = "haps_illumina", n_reads = 500e6, paired = TRUE,
         read_length = 100, sep_files = TRUE)
```



## Constructing a phylogeny

### From one phylogenetic tree

This section shows how `jackalope` can generate haplotypes from a phylogeny, then
simulate sequencing data from those haplotypes to test phylogeny reconstruction methods.
First, I generated a random coalescent tree of 10 species using the  `ape` package.

```{r examples-phylogeny-tree}
tree <- rcoal(10)
```

Then I input that to the `create_haplotypes` function alongside the molecular evolution
information.

```{r examples-phylogeny-tree-create-for-show}
haps <- create_haplotypes(ref, haps_phylo(tree), sub, ins, del)
```


This results in the following `haplotypes` object:

```{r examples-phylogeny-tree-haplotypes-print, echo = FALSE}
print(haps)
```


Now I can generate data for 1 flow cell of $2 \times 250$bp sequencing
on an Illumina MiSeq v3.

```{r examples-phylogeny-tree-illumina, eval = FALSE}
illumina(haps, out_prefix = "phylo_tree", seq_sys = "MSv3",
         read_length = 250, n_reads = 50e6)
```



### From gene trees

Similar to the section above, the ultimate goal here is to test phylogeny
reconstruction methods.
The difference in this section is that instead of using a single, straightforward
phylogeny, I use multiple gene trees per chromosome.
In the species used in these simulations, species 3 diverged from 1 and 2 at $t = 0.5$,
where $t$ indicates time into the past and is in units of $4 N_0$ generations.
Species 1 and 2 diverged at $t = 0.25$.
I assume a recombination rate of $1 / (4 N_0)$ recombination events per chromosome
per generation.
Because each chromosome is a different length and the length is required for including
a recombination rate, I had to run `scrm` separately for each chromosome.
There are 4 diploid individuals sampled per species.


```{r examples-phylogeny-gtrees-scrm, eval = FALSE}
# Run scrm for one chromosome size:
one_chrom <- function(size) {
    sims <- scrm(
        paste("24 1",
              # Output gene trees:
              "-T",
              # Recombination:
              "-r 1", size,
              # 3 species with no ongoing migration:
              "-I 3", paste(rep("8", 3), collapse = " "), "0",
              # Species 2 derived from 1 at time 1.0:
              "-ej 0.5 2 1",  
              # Species 3 derived from 2 at time 0.5:
              "-ej 0.25 3 2"
        ))
    return(sims$trees[[1]])
}
# For all chromosomes:
gtrees <- list(trees = lapply(ref$sizes(), one_chrom))
```

```{r examples-phylogeny-gtrees-create-haplotypes, eval = FALSE}
haps <- create_haplotypes(ref, haps_gtrees(gtrees),
                        sub, ins, del)
```
```{r examples-phylogeny-gtrees-create-do, echo = FALSE}
# For the purposes of the vignette, I'm just going to use `haps_theta` so I
# don't have to (1) load scrm to build the vignette or (2) keep a relatively
# large internal data file to store the scrm output
# theta of 0.05 gives the same # mutations as using `ssites`
set.seed(7809534)
haps <- create_haplotypes(ref, haps_theta(theta = 0.005, n_haps = 24), sub, ins, del)
```


This results in the following `haplotypes` object:

```{r examples-phylogeny-gtrees-haplotypes-print, echo = FALSE}
print(haps)
```


To store mutation information by diploid sample, the `write_vcf` function writes
the `haplotypes` object to a VCF file.
It assigns haplotypes to diploid samples using a matrix for the
`sample_matrix` argument:

```{r examples-phylogeny-write-vcf, eval = FALSE}
write_vcf(haps, out_prefix = "hap_gtrees",
          sample_matrix = matrix(1:haps$n_haps(), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE))
```


Now I can generate data for 1 flow cell of $2 \times 250$bp sequencing
on an Illumina MiSeq v3.

```{r examples-phylogeny-gtrees-illumina, eval = FALSE}
illumina(ref, out_prefix = "phylo_gtrees",
         seq_sys = "MSv3",
         paired = TRUE,
         read_length = 250,
         n_reads = 50e6)
```
